# Contest-1
For assembly class.

## Project Overview
This is a **Blackjack (21)**-style game written entirely in **MASM Assembly** using the **Irvine32 library**.  
The project was created for the in-class programming contest and demonstrates loops, conditionals, procedure calls, and random number generation.

## 🧩 Game Rules
- Two players: **Player 1 (user)** and **Player 2 (computer)**.  
- Each player starts with one random card (1–10).  
- The user can choose to **draw** another card or **stay**.  
- The computer automatically draws until its total is **16 or higher**.  
- Whoever gets closer to 21 without going over wins the round.  
- After **3 rounds**, if Player 1 has more losses → “**You died.**”  
  Otherwise → “**You’ve survived.**”
